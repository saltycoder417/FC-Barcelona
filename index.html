        <h3>The beginnings:</h3>
        <p>
            The club was founded on 22 October 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan (a state in Spain), German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper, making it one of the oldest football clubs in the world. They won their first trophy, Copa Macaya in 1902. Walter wild was the first president of the club, and he got Barca a home ground. They had a successful start, winning several trophies in the early 1900s, however in 1908, the club was struggling financially, socially, and in performance. They had not won a competition since 1905. Joan Gamper then became the club president. He said in a meeting, "Barcelona cannot die and must not die. If there is nobody who is going to try, then I will assume the responsibility of running the club from now on." He was club president on five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925, spending a total of 25 years in the role. One of his main achievements was ensuring Barça acquired its own stadium and thus generated a stable income. 
        </p>
        <p>
            On 14 March 1909, the team moved into the Camp de la Indústria, a stadium with a capacity of 8,000. To celebrate their new surroundings, the club conducted a logo contest the following year. Carles Comamala won the contest, and his suggestion became the crest that the club still wears with some minor changes as of the present day.

        <h3>Fanbase and support:</h3>
        <p>
            The club is a fan owned club. Along with Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao, and Osasuna, Barcelona is organised as a registered association. Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only membership. The members of Barcelona, called socis, form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Barca fans are reffered to as culers. The nickname culer for a Barcelona supporter is derived from the Catalan cul (English: arse), as the spectators at the first stadium, Camp de la Indústria, sat with their culs over the stand. The club has one of the largest fanbases in the world and the second largest in europe. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to membership, as of March 2022 there are 1,264 officially registered fan clubs, called penyes, around the world.[192] The fan clubs promote Barcelona in their locality and receive beneficial offers when visiting Barcelona.
